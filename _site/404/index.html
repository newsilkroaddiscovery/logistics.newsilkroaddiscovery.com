First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all. What is Jekyll?: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server. Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free. "

We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.  Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson.

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture.

When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

    "body": "There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

    "title": "Is Intelligence Enough",
    "body": "Be Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

    "body": "2024/08/09 - A container explosion aboard the Liberian-registered cargo ship YM Mobility rocked the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port today, sending debris flying and billowing thick black smoke into the sky. The explosion, linked to a hazardous goods container, occurred in the Beilun area of the port, one of the busiest shipping terminals in the world. State media, including Xinhua, confirmed that despite the intensity of the blast, no casualties or injuries have been reported. The incident has raised significant concerns about safety protocols and the handling of dangerous materials at major shipping hubs. Videos shared on social media captured the moment the explosion sent a large plume of smoke into the air, with flaming debris scattering across the port. The ship, operated by Taiwanese shipping company Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, was docked at the Beilun terminal when the explosion occurred. The Ningbo Maritime Search and Rescue Centre quickly identified the presence of hazardous materials on board, which prompted immediate safety measures. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation, with investigations underway to determine the exact nature of the hazardous materials involved. Preliminary findings suggest the explosion originated from a reefer (refrigerated) container being used as a dry container substitute, which did not require a power connection. However, the specifics of the materials inside the container have not yet been disclosed. The incident at Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, a critical hub for global trade, highlights several key concerns:    Safety Concerns: The explosion underscores the ongoing risks associated with the transportation and storage of hazardous materials in global shipping operations. Authorities are expected to review and potentially tighten safety protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.     Operational Disruptions: As one of the busiest ports worldwide, any disruption at Ningbo-Zhoushan could ripple through global supply chains, potentially delaying cargo deliveries and impacting trade flows.     Environmental Risks: Depending on the hazardous materials involved, there could be environmental repercussions, including risks to marine life and local ecosystems. Further investigations will determine if clean-up efforts are necessary.     Insurance and Liability: The explosion may trigger complex insurance claims and legal disputes, particularly concerning damages to port infrastructure and surrounding areas.     Reputational Impact: Both Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation and Ningbo port authorities may face scrutiny regarding their safety records and the handling of dangerous goods.  In response to the explosion, emergency measures were swiftly implemented:  The Ningbo Maritime Search and Rescue Center activated an emergency response plan to manage the situation and coordinate rescue efforts.  Evacuations were advised in the vicinity of the explosion to ensure public safety, with authorities restricting access to the affected area.  Health advisories were issued, urging residents near the site to stay indoors and avoid exposure to smoke, particularly those with respiratory conditions. Investigations are ongoing, and authorities will provide updates as more information becomes available. The port remains under close observation, with safety and operational assessments continuing into the night. "

    "title": "Rail attacks at Paris Olympics highlight security vulnerabilities in the Eurasian rail freight network",
    "body": "2024/07/26 - Today’s society relies heavily on the continuous and reliable functioning of infrastructure systems such as telecommunications, electric power, gas and oil, water supply, and transportation. These systems are so essential that any interruption in their services can have crippling effects on citizens’ well-being, the nation’s economy, and society as a whole. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to various threats, including natural hazards, component aging, increased demand, climate change, sabotage, and cascading failures due to their interdependencies.  In some cases, the network could recover from incidents, but if the critical infrastructure is under attack, a serious failure of the network may happen1. The sabotage of the railway is becoming more frequent. On July 26, 2024, just hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games, France’s high-speed rail network was severely disrupted by coordinated acts of sabotage, including arson attacks. These incidents targeted the TGV lines connecting Paris to various regions and neighboring countries, causing widespread travel chaos. Fires were reported near the tracks on the Atlantique, Nord, and Est high-speed lines, particularly affecting Paris’ major Montparnasse station. The attacks paralyzed several high-speed lines, leading to the cancellation and diversion of numerous trains. This disruption affected not only Olympic athletes and officials but also thousands of travelers, causing significant delays and cancellations. The incidents underscored the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and prompted a reevaluation of rail security policies. In 2023, sabotage targeted crucial communication cables, leading to widespread disruptions in rail services across northern Germany. The attacks caused severe delays and cancellations, affecting thousands of passengers and freight operations. However, Eurasian rail freight travels through multiple countries, there is lacking of intergovernmental mechanism to protect this intercontinental rail route. Eurasian rail transport is a critical component of the global supply chain, connecting vast regions from Europe to Asia. It has grown in significance, particularly after crises like the Red Sea shipping disruptions since Jan. 2024, which have highlighted the vulnerabilities and strategic importance of alternative transport routes. However, this extensive intercontinental rail network faces several security challenges that could disrupt operations and threaten the safety of goods. The security concerns span a range of issues, including terrorist attacks, vandalism, and cyber threats. These risks not only pose immediate dangers but also have long-term impacts on supply chain.  Eurasian rail networks today face a variety of risks that can significantly disrupt operations::  Terrorist Attacks: Terrorist groups view rail systems as high-profile targets due to their accessibility and the potential for mass casualties and economic disruption. For instance, the German-Poland border (Frankfurt (Oder)) and the Belarus-Poland border (Małaszewicze) are areas of concern. They are vulnerable to sabotage, with limited tracks and inadequate contingency plans in the short term. If sabotage were to occur at these two borders, the entire Eurasian railway network could be compromised.  Vandalism: Acts of vandalism, ranging from graffiti to the deliberate destruction of tracks and equipment, can cause substantial delays and repair costs. These activities are often politically motivated or carried out by disaffected individuals.  Cyber Threats: The increasing reliance on digital systems for rail operations has introduced vulnerabilities to cyberattacks or internet blackout. Hackers can target control systems, potentially causing derailments, schedule disruptions, and significant safety hazards. The internet blackout during the 2020 elections in Belarus significantly impacted the information transmission of the Eurasian rail freight.  Several security measures could be implemented across the Eurasian rail network to mitigate these risks::  Surveillance Systems: Advanced CCTV and monitoring systems are in place at major rail hubs and along critical sections of the rail network. These systems help in the early detection of suspicious activities.  Physical Security Enhancements: Barriers, fencing, and controlled access points have been established to protect rail infrastructure. Regular patrols and inspections are conducted to ensure the integrity of these physical security measures.  Innovation in Technology: Investing in advanced technologies like AI-powered surveillance and blockchain for supply chain transparency can improve security.  Intergovernmental Collaboration: Establishing international security frameworks and regular dialogues among the involved countries can foster better coordination and response strategies. However, the current Russia-Ukraine war will make this more challenging.  Cybersecurity Protocols: Robust cybersecurity frameworks have been developed to protect against digital threats. These include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular audits of IT infrastructure.  Coordination and Response: Effective coordination between rail operators, law enforcement, and emergency services is crucial. Joint exercises and real-time information sharing help in maintaining a state of readiness.  Legal framework across Borders: To protect the critical infrastructure, The European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) includes the Council Directive 2008/114/EC, which focuses on identifying and improving the protection of critical infrastructures across Europe. In the USA, the Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-7) establishes policies for critical infrastructure protection, identifying 17 sectors, each led by a federal Sector-Specific Agency to enhance protection and resilience.  Eurasian rail network that span multiple countries need harmonized security protocols. This requires international cooperation and standardization of security measures. Future Outlook: The coordinated sabotage of France’s high-speed rail network during the Paris Olympic Games underscores the critical need for robust security measures for critical infrastructure . While significant challenges remain, ongoing technological advancements and international cooperation are essential to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Eurasian rail transport. Policymakers and stakeholders must prioritize security to protect this critical infrastructure of the Eurasian rail transport. Implementing comprehensive security strategies that combine physical, digital, and procedural elements will be essential to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Eurasian rail networks. Policymakers and stakeholders must prioritize security investments and foster international cooperation to address the dynamic nature of rail transport risks.

    "body": "2024/01/01 - In the year 2023, the China-Europe freight train has reached 17,000 trips, transporting 1. 9 million TEUs, marking a notable increase of 6% and 18% year-on-year, as per the statistics released by the China State Railway Group. More precise data from China Railway Container Transport (CRCT) reveals that there were 17,523 trips and 1,901,949 TEUs in 2023. Among these, 9,343 trips were westbound, while 8,180 trips were designated for eastbound transportation.        © 2024 New Silkroad Discovery. All rights reserved.  Figure 1: Development of China-Europe Freight Trains since 2011 Notably, excluding the initial two months due to the Spring Festival holiday, over 1,400 trains operated during the remaining 10 months of 2023. The peak months were November with 1,561 trips and July with 1,552 trips.         © 2024 New Silkroad Discovery. All rights reserved.    Figure 1: Monthly trains in both directions (China-Europe) 2023 Examining Chinese border crossings, Alashankou Port maintained its position as the port with the highest rail freight traffic. With the rapid growth in China-Russia trade, both the China-Russia border crossing at Manzhouli Port and the China/Mongolia border port of Erenhot experienced substantial increases in traffic. In contrast to other ports, Manzhouli and Suifenhe ports demonstrated a notable trend of more return trips than outbound trips, establishing them as the preferred customs clearance ports for Russian import cargo. Tongjiang Railway Port made significant strides, initiating its first outbound train in July 2023 and the first return train at the end of October. This development bodes well for the future, aligning with the upward trajectory of China-Russia trade.         © 2024 New Silkroad Discovery. All rights reserved.    Figure 2: Train Trips via different border crossings 2023 On the city front, Xi’an, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou maintained their positions as the top four cities. The platform companies in Changsha, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Yiwu, Shenyang, and Hefei all operated over 500 trains in 2023.       © 2024 New Silkroad Discovery. All rights reserved.      Figure 3: Ranking of departures from different provinces in 2023  Decrease on China-Europe routes excl. Russian routes: It is noteworthy that the aforementioned figures encompass the freight volume on the China-Russia routes. Excluding the Russian routes, the volume of freight transport between China and European countries witnessed a further decrease. As reported by the ERAI EURASIAN RAIL ALLIANCE INDEX (index1520) for 2023, encompassing China and several European countries including Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, Spain, Italy, and France, a total of 211,110 TEUs were transported along the China-Europe routes. This indicates a significant decrease of 48. 57% compared to 2022 and represents only one-third of the 2021 figure, which stood at 618,180 TEUs. One notable consequence of the decline in freight volumes is the continual improvement in transport duration, with the average station-to-station transport time reducing to a mere 9. 9 days. Westbound to Poland, eastbound from Germany: Poland continued to lead among European countries with the highest containerized cargo arriving on westbound trains, amounting to 117,628 TEUs, albeit experiencing a 34. 11% year-on-year decline. Meanwhile, rail freight from China to Germany faced a substantial decline, with only 12,866 TEUs in 2023, marking an 80. 02% drop. On the eastbound shipment front, Germany, known for its robust product exports, remained the country that shipped the most containers to China, reaching 58,282 TEUs but still experiencing a 45. 68% year-on-year decline.

    "title": "Exclusive interview with Qi Dan",
    "body": "2023/11/09 - On August 22, 2023, Dan QI, the General Manager of Yuxinou (Chongqing) Logistics Co. , Ltd. , bid a heartfelt farewell to his colleagues in his personal social circle. Yuxinou is the first platform company in China to operate the China-Europe freight train service. Dan QI has led this company for over a decade. He wrote: “… What’s more important is whether the more than a decade of effort we’ve put in together is worth it. This depends on the future of the company in the next three, five, ten, twenty, and even thirty years. Without a future, all our current efforts will fade into insignificance, and they might even be forgotten, despite being a part of real history. With a future, our current efforts become precious and worthwhile, and they will be engraved in history. Therefore, I hope that my young comrades will do something for the future of the company. I envy the youthful years you possess. Although I’m leaving Yuxinou, you continue to stand firm and strive. If I must express regret, it’s simply that we won’t be sharing the same trench day in and day out, but my heart will always be with you and with Yuxinou…”  New Silkroad Discovery: Mr. Dan QI, what is the one thing you find it most difficult to part with and can’t let go of in your heart?: Dan QI: It is undoubtedly the career of the China-Europe freight train service and the emotional connection with the entire Yuxinou team. I was seconded to the Logistics Office of Chongqing Municipal Government in 2011, initially responsible for the Chongqing International Air Cargo “Ice-Breaking” project, and later involved in the establishment of Yuxinou and related work. It has been more than a decade since then. Over these years, we have witnessed and been actively involved in the growth and development of Yuxinou and the entire China-Europe freight train industry. Along this journey, we have overcome many unknown challenges together and gained valuable experiences. The entire team has established deep bonds, and in a sense, we are like a family. This career is akin to our “child,” and we have invested a lot of effort into it. Seeing it thrive fills us with genuine happiness and pride. Now, saying goodbye to the “family” and “child” that have been with me for over a decade naturally brings a deep sense of reluctance and attachment in my heart.  New Silkroad Discovery: Looking back on the work of the past decade, what achievements of Yuxinou make you most proud? Could you share a few moments or highlights with us?: Dan QI: Yuxinou, as the first comprehensive logistics service provider representing Chongqing’s “Going Global” strategy, uniquely combining renowned brands, a national 5A-level logistics enterprise, and a five-star multimodal transport operator, has achieved several commendable accomplishments in its development. Personally, what I’m most proud of is its role in driving Chongqing’s outward openness and industrial development, especially its strategic significance during special times. In 2014, we embarked on the exploration of running public trains for various industries, and subsequently, we developed various innovative transportation projects, including full-container loads, cold chain logistics, cross-border e-commerce, and more. As Yuxinou’s services steadily expanded, Chongqing also obtained approvals for multiple railway ports such as the automobile complete vehicle import port, the international mail handling center, and the bioproducts port. This led to a global “eight consecutive championships” in IT product output, the establishment of trillion-yuan level industrial clusters in the automobile and electronic information sectors, and the development of two national-level bonded zones, significantly raising the city’s level of outward openness. I believe this is a proactive response to the strategic positioning and goals for Chongqing, and Yuxinou has become a key driver in the creation of Chongqing’s inland openness and will continue to contribute to elevating the city’s openness and industrial economic development. In early 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly erupted, maritime and air transport were severely impacted. It was during this time that the strategic role of China-Europe freight trains became even more apparent. I vividly recall that all of us acted promptly. First, we formed an emergency task force and were the first in the country to introduce the “Yuxinou (China-Europe freight train) COVID-19 Medical Supplies Transport Emergency Plan,” providing solutions for medical supply procurement entities and offering free warehouse space, free international railway transportation, and other support services for emergency goods. Our entire team, including on-site personnel ensuring the dispatch of train services and office staff on 24-hour standby, worked tirelessly to ensure uninterrupted and stable train operations. This included Yuxinou and other China-Europe freight train services, which became a “lifeline” for global cooperation in combating the pandemic.  New Silkroad Discovery: Innovation and perseverance are among the most valuable qualities in any entrepreneurial endeavor. Where do you think Yuxinou’s innovation is reflected? What has Yuxinou been persistent in achieving?: Dan QI: Yuxinou’s innovation is reflected in its willingness to explore and break new ground. Over its development of more than a decade, Yuxinou has consistently adhered to the brand essence of “innovation, openness, connectivity, and mission,” continuously exploring new paths, and pioneering numerous innovative experiences, providing new directions for industry development. For instance, in the establishment of new rules for land-based trade, Yuxinou broke the international railway postal ban and was the first to achieve two-way international railway postal connectivity. Subsequently, this international railway postal model was replicated and extended to other cities like Yiwu, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, and played a crucial role during the pandemic. Yuxinou explored multimodal transport under a single document and issued the first “Railway Bill of Lading International Letter of Credit. ” It actively promoted the use of bill of lading property rights and financial attributes, implementing the first blockchain electronic bill of lading financing business for China-Europe freight trains. Yuxinou took the lead in improving China-Europe freight train transport efficiency by initiating projects like “Railway-Government Communication,” joint actions for transportation safety in countries along the route, and achieving two-way connectivity of “railway express” mode for imports and exports, effectively ensuring the safe and convenient transport of China-Europe freight trains and enhancing inland logistics organizational capacity. In accelerating the innovation of logistics supply chain service models, Yuxinou was the first to conduct the industry’s first cross-border RMB payment transaction, reinforcing settlement security in foreign trade, and innovating with “blockchain + cross-border finance. ” It strengthened cooperation between banks and enterprises, effectively addressing the financing challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises. These efforts represent Yuxinou’s innovative contributions to the betterment of the industry. I believe that in the future, Yuxinou will continue to adhere to its original mission and persist in its exploration, playing an even more active role in leading the industry’s innovative development.  New Silkroad Discovery: You mentioned that there are structural changes occurring at the national level in terms of route planning, overseas channel layout, and capacity deployment for China-Europe freight trains. How should we interpret these changes, and how can industry participants adapt to, engage in, and drive these changes?: Dan QI: At the national level, structural changes are underway concerning route planning, overseas channel layout, and capacity deployment for China-Europe freight trains. China-Central Asia, China-Vietnam, and China-Laos (Thailand), among other rail services, have been incorporated into the overall development plan for China-Europe freight trains over the next 3 to 5 years. This extension of the China-Europe freight train service network aims to enhance connectivity between ASEAN, China, and Central Asia. Additionally, active participation in international cooperation for Trans-Caspian routes is taking place to further improve the southern routes of the China-Europe freight train. As an industry practitioner, I believe it’s important to proactively change one’s perspective and make strategic adjustments in line with the overall development plan. Strengthening the development of the southern route for China-Europe freight trains is crucial. Continuously improving the train’s resilience to risks and further expanding routes and resource allocation in regions such as Central Asia and Southeast Asia is essential. By running freight train services, these regions’ economies can be more closely linked, promoting deeper exchanges in terms of trade, culture, and other aspects.  New Silkroad Discovery: The growth of the China-Europe freight train has transitioned from “infancy to adolescence,” but in order to become a century-long endeavor, what further considerations are needed?: Dan QI: For the China-Europe freight train service to become a century-long endeavor, it is first and foremost essential to always remember its mission and responsibilities and consistently fulfill its positive role in supporting the “Belt and Road” initiative. Building on this foundation, efforts can be directed towards cost reduction, increased efficiency, and alignment with the volume and market environment, striving to achieve the vision of making the China-Europe freight train truly market-oriented. This also requires the collaborative efforts of all relevant departments, businesses, and all parties along the entire China-Europe freight train supply chain to jointly maintain the stability of the China-Europe freight train market. Emphasis on market-oriented operation is crucial to promote the industry’s healthy, sustainable development and to continually unlock the potential and vitality of the China-Europe freight train. "

    "title": "Interview – Mr. Hans Reinhard, Chairman of InterRail Group",
    "body": "2020/09/07 -  New Silkroad Discovery: 2020, the outbreak of the epidemic (Corona-19) has given new opportunities for international rail transport. In the first half of 2020, the number of China-European trains increased by 36% year-on-year. You must have felt this change, what has your company achieved in the field of China-EU rail freight this year?: Mr. Hans Reinhard: As the China-Europe trains are considered as a complementary to air and sea freight, and as the airfreight sector were hit the most during the last months, we indeed observed an increasing demand on the China-EU tradelane since China’s return to production. Where as China was the first country hit by the pandemic, it originally was also the first country to (suddenly) reduce the numbers of trains thus the start in 2020 was extremely slow – then China re-started once the pandemic became controlled in China but at same time, COVID brought Westeurope into complete lockdown thus again March and April were very slow months as far as train departures between China and Europe were concerned. As of May however, we could feel an increasing demand which even included regular blocktrains of postal shipments and since May, the numbers of trains has permanently increased reaching the peak in June/July. InterRail could face an increase of about 35% compared to figures of same period in 2019 were we operated approx 4 trains weekly.  New Silkroad Discovery: Could you please describe the markets that your company currently focuses on? What are your advantages compared to other European competitors?: Mr. Hans Reinhard: With rail-focused services, InterRail addresses customers across the entire Eurasian region respectively along the New Silk Road. To support its freight brokerage services, InterRail draws on its own container fleet, and in the CIS, on its own and leased rolling stock. As a neutral service provider, the group moreover operates container block trains between Western Europe, Russia, the other CIS countries, Central Asia and China. We also operate our own block trains and individual wagons within the CIS/Russia. In addition to container transportation, our competence also includes the transport of goods in conventional rail wagons, like project and bulk cargo (cotton/fertilizers). Among InterRail customers are forwarding and transport companies as well as ocean carriers and shipping lines. InterRail has direct contracts with all the national railways in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and is specialized on CIS transit. The service portfolio also comprises end-to-end freight rates, documentation management, pre- and on-carriage, tracking and container provision. For the smooth transport of rail freight between Europe and Asia, it takes a partner that is at home in every culture. That’s the strength of InterRail, due to its presence of long years in all the major states along this trade lane, with locations in Belarus, China, Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. We are on site at all critical interfaces with our own employees. As an affiliate of the TransInvest Group (St. Gallen, Switzerland), InterRail can additionally rely on the dense TransInvest network. With the competent expertise of its staff and its long-time market presence, InterRail stands for top excellence in service.  New Silkroad Discovery: Last year you stated that the future growth of China-European shuttles would be significantly affected as the Chinese government subsidies are reduced year by year (to 30% in 2020 and 20% in 2021). Has this year’s outbreak of the epidemic changed many things, and how do you see the future growth of the China-EU rail freight?: Mr. Hans Reinhard: We believe that due to the pandemic, the reduction of the subsidies has not yet affected the number of train departures yet as there was a large backlog demand on different goods and commodities which the rail transport could benefit from. Secondly, the suboperators, ie. the state railways have positively supported this kind of transport by further reduction of their rates and tariffs to absorb part of the missing subsidizes, and secondly, by creating longer trains on CIS territory, ie linking 3 chinese trains into 2 CIS trains. We however can also observe that some Chinese platforms have already started to focus more on shorter distances/destinations, ie mainly to Russia and Central Asia where less subsidies will be necessary. On the long run, we still expect that present boom will not continue on long term base but volumes will stay solid on about 2019 average figures. A further effect we can notice is the fact that due to less subsidies, the elbow fights between the different operators on rates and conditions have increased and the demand on intermediate financing by western operators has also increased.  New Silkroad Discovery: At the end of June and into July, there was a backlog of cargo and congestion in Alashankou, China, which led many Chinese shuttle companies to reduce their schedules and cancel some trips. Recently, there have been reports of congestion in Małaszewicze, Poland, and Bres, Belarus. Could you please introduce more about the relevant situation?: Mr. Hans Reinhard: The situation at Alashankou / Dostyk has meanwhile get partly relaxed again where as Brest/Malascewicze has indeed become a extremely troublesome interface which is due to huge volumes of trains but also due to present construction works on both sides. InterRail still benefits from using private railway undertaking thus we can offer our “own” wagons and traction where as some state railways are also focusing lack of empty wagons. We are afraid that the situation at Brest / Mala will not come to former quality within short thus new routings will certainly profit from present situation (other border crossings, intermodal solutions via Russian, Baltic or German ports etc).  New Silkroad Discovery: Finally, please reveal your company’s next business development plans. What can the market expect from InterRail in the next 2 to 3 year？: Mr. Hans Reinhard: InterRail is basically focusing on three corridors ie East/West, China – Europe, but also Asia – Central Asia thus we want further growth and expand our existing blocktrain traffics via Vostochyn into Central Asia but at same increase the numbers of trains on Trans-China traffic from / to Central Asia. Secondly, we are presently extending our services between Asia (mainly China) and Turkey, and last but not least, we want to further expand our already very strong position in the North/South corridor, ie to serve India and the CIS states. To reach this targets, we shall further invest in own or leased rolling stock to be able to offer “one package deals” out of one hand. "

    "title": "Interview with Prof. Wang Derong, Beijing Institute of Logistics & Transport of ZJX",
    "body": "2020/06/05 -  Please tell us about your recent research project, what new gains have you made in the development of China Europe freight train?: Beijing Institute of Logistics &amp; Transport of ZJX have started the comprehensive investigation of the integration of transportation, trade, industry and city on China-Europe freight train since the 4th quarter of 2019, in order to carry the Belt and Road Initiative(BRI) , implement the strategy of transportation power and promote the high-quality development of China-Europe freight train. The research contents mainly included the operating quality, the hub layout , intelligent transportation, the stable supply chain and melt situation and so on. We have made the new achievements in the development of China-Europe freight train, mainly as follows: In Prof. Wang Derong view, First, the China-Europe freight train is conducive to promoting the economic and trade development of countries and regions along the route. The quantity and quality of the trains operation are constantly improving, which has been paid more and more attention by all walks of the economy and society. Second, the new progress has been made in the interconnection of the infrastructure of trains, not only to enhance the freight capacity of the international transport corridor, but also to play the role of the strategic channel of international trade. Third, the layout of the China-Europe train hub is gradually optimized. Give full play to the role of “hub to hub” in the efficient collection and distribution system. Fourth, in the context of free trade zone, the development of cross-border E-commerce of the China-Europe train has played a prominent role in the internationalization of inland cities. Fifth, the construction of the China-Europe train intelligent information platform has been steadily promoted. Intellectualization has become an important platform for trains to connect coastal ports and inland hinterland development. Sixth, China-EU has played an active role in international cargo transportation and the resumption of work, production. The stability and competitiveness of the supply chain of the China-Europe train has been put on the important agenda, which is the real “road of life” between Eurasia.  In your opinion, what is the significance of the development of China Europe freight trains to accelerate the construction of China’s modern integrated transportation system?: Prof. Wang Derong thinks that the development of China-EU trains plays the significant role in accelerating the construction of China’s modern comprehensive transportation system. First, the interconnection infrastructure network of the China-EU trains, including the construction of international corridors, and hubs, promoting the effective connection of domestic inter regional and international transportation networks, and strengthening the construction of the comprehensive transportation network facing the world; Second, as a high value-added cargo between China and Europe, the China-EU trains are the new supplement of transportation mode which not only strengthens the economic and trade cooperation between China and EU, but also optimizes the transportation structure of our country, and improves the logistics efficiency; Third , the R &amp; D of equipment such as cold chain logistics of the China – EU trains, promotes the technical upgrading of comprehensive transportation equipment; Fourth, the intelligent and green construction of the China-EU trains, plays a significant exemplary role in the construction of modern comprehensive transportation system scientific and technological innovation and environmental protection conservation; Fifth, the response capacity enhancing of international emergency on the China-EU trains , promote the construction of comprehensive transportation system emergency system, and ensure the stability of global supply chain. Sixth, the integration of transportation and trade to the China-Europe train will promote the melt of a comprehensive transportation system and economy.  We know that Alibaba’s Cainiao Logistics also launched a special e-commerce train last year. In your opinion, what role does the construction of China’s smart logistics backbone network play in promoting the high-quality development of China Europe freight trains?: In my view, China Smart Logistic Network (CSN) is the top-level design for the high-quality development of China’s logistics industry in the new era, and it is a Chinese solution contributing to the global supply chain. CSN plays an important role in promoting the high-quality development of China- Europe train. First, CSN promotes the intensive operation of China-EU trains. CSN considers the comprehensive transportation corridors and hubs from an international perspective, and innovates the “hub to hub” transportation organization mode of trains. Second, CSN promote the international development of the train, which gives full play to the advantages of global network, provides the “one-stop” efficient service of the China- Europe train global supply chain, gives full play to the advantages of multimodal transport, and promotes the facilitation of international trade of trains. Third, CSN promotes the market-oriented construction of trains. Through the construction of train platform, CSN uses the digital port to carry out value-added services such as LCL and return pick-up, give full play to the advantages of the China-Europe train and realize the green vision. Fourth, cultivate new driving force of the train. CSN carries out cross-border e-commerce train business, integrates bonded warehousing, sorting and distribution, picking and packing, and LCL services in the qualified comprehensive bonded zone, and cultivates a new economic growth pole.  What are your suggestions for future investment and mergers of Chinese companies in overseas logistics and real estate infrastructure?: After recent years’ development, the platform and freight forwarding company of the China-Europe train have been “going global” and expanding international business. For the “going global” of Chinese logistics enterprises, I believe that we should adhere to the principle of opening to the outside world, judge the opportunities and challenges faced in the future, actively carry out international supply chain business, and make strategic layout planning at important hub nodes. For the future investment and merger of Chinese enterprises in overseas real estate and other infrastructure, my suggestions are as follows: first, optimize the strategic layout of the overseas hub. Carefully analyze the development trend of local economy and trade, understand and be familiar with the local political environment, folk customs, etc. , analyze and prevent risks; second, encourage the diversification of investment and financing channels. Third, to provide local economic development and employment opportunities.  While promoting the development of China Europe freight trains, it also requires the support of governments and civil society along the route. What can be done to the New Silkroad Discovery in this process?: In my view, the China-EU train has promoted the construction of the “the Five-Connectivity Program”, the connectivity of policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people. It needs the support of the government and the people, and the support of international public opinion is particularly important. The media of the China-Europe train industry adhere to the principle of innovation, use new media, grasp the pulse of the times, actively promote the “going out” of China’s logistics enterprises, improve the construction and reform of the global traffic governance system, promote the “Introduction” and “going out” of the China-Europe train in policies, rules, systems, technologies and standards, and enhance the international voice and influence of the industry.  Recently, many ministries and commissions such as the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Commerce, and the General Administration of Customs have issued guidance on the work of China Europe freight trains. What information did you read? Can you share it with our readers?: In order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 and further play the role of the China-Europe train, many ministries and commissions in China have issued guidance on relevant work, mainly as follows: First, use the China-Europe train to help enterprises resume to work and serve Wuhan; Second, we strengthen the construction of the China-EU train assembly center, promote the diversification of China-EU train export channels; Third, enhance the internationalization of China Europe train enterprises To build an international multimodal transport logistics service network focusing on China Europe train. The fourth is to guide enterprises to make full use of the customs clearance and facilitation policies of the China-EU trains, and is to encourage the replication and promotion of the innovation results of the China-EU trains in the pilot free trade zone; the fifth is to ensure that foreign-funded enterprises can equally apply the support policies of the China EU trains; the sixth is to do a good job in the early warning and consultation of the restrictive measures of countries along with the China-EU trains, and strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic situation of the China-EU trains. Seventh we will strengthen the stability and competitiveness of the international supply chain of China Europe trains and give priority to international cooperation in the transportation of anti-epidemic materials. Eighth, to support the development of cold chain logistics and other new industries of the China-EU trains and improve the level of information technology.  How do you predict and analyze the overall development trend of China Europe freight trains in the next two years?: With the outbreak of the COVID-19, China has encountered many difficulties and challenges in its development. The WTO （issued on 8 April 2020）estimates that world merchandise trade could decline by between 12. 9% and 31. 9% in 2020. Compared with sea transportation and air transportation, the China-EU trains still maintain normal and stable transportation, and the overall trend of development will continue to grow rapidly in the next two years.  Finally, what do you want to say to the New Silkroad Discovery’s readers?: I think that New Silkroad Discovery is the whole media for the high-quality development of the China-Europe Railway promoted by the Internet, which grasps the pulse of the times. The media is widely integrated with the government, entrepreneurs, experts, etc. it has a wide range of communication power and external publicity windows. The new technology, mechanism and model of news communication attracts many fans. Thanks for fans’ attention to the development of China-Europe Freight Railway. Thank you for your attention to the China-Europe Freight Railway, which is the landmark achievement of the “Belt and Road” construction is the contribution of the growth of train.
