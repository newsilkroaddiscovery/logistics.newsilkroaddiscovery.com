<p>The sabotage of the railway is becoming more frequent. On July 26, 2024, just hours before the opening ceremony of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Paris Olympic Games</code>, France’s high-speed rail network was severely disrupted by coordinated acts of sabotage, including arson attacks. These incidents targeted the TGV lines connecting Paris to various regions and neighboring countries, causing widespread travel chaos. Fires were reported near the tracks on the Atlantique, Nord, and Est high-speed lines, particularly affecting Paris’ major Montparnasse station. The attacks paralyzed several high-speed lines, leading to the cancellation and diversion of numerous trains. This disruption affected not only Olympic athletes and officials but also thousands of travelers, causing significant delays and cancellations. The incidents underscored the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and prompted a reevaluation of rail security policies. In 2023, sabotage targeted crucial communication cables, leading to widespread disruptions in rail services across <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">northern Germany</code>. The attacks caused severe delays and cancellations, affecting thousands of passengers and freight operations.</p>

<p>However, Eurasian rail freight travels through multiple countries, there is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lacking of intergovernmental mechanism</code> to protect this intercontinental rail route. Eurasian rail transport is a critical component of the global supply chain, connecting vast regions from Europe to Asia. It has grown in significance, particularly after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crises like the Red Sea shipping disruptions</code> since Jan.2024, which have highlighted the vulnerabilities and strategic importance of alternative transport routes. However, this extensive intercontinental rail network faces several security challenges that could disrupt operations and threaten the safety of goods. The security concerns span a range of issues, including <strong>terrorist attacks, vandalism, and cyber threats</strong>. These risks not only pose immediate dangers but also have long-term impacts on  supply chain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="eurasian-rail-networks-today-face-a-variety-of-risks-that-can-significantly-disrupt-operations">Eurasian rail networks today face a variety of risks that can significantly disrupt operations:</h4>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Terrorist Attacks: Terrorist groups view rail systems as high-profile targets due to their accessibility and the potential for mass casualties and economic disruption. For instance, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">German-Poland border (Frankfurt (Oder)) and the Belarus-Poland border (Małaszewicze)</code> are areas of concern. They are vulnerable to sabotage, with limited tracks and inadequate contingency plans in the short term. If sabotage were to occur at these two borders, the entire Eurasian railway network could be compromised.</li>
  <li>Vandalism: Acts of vandalism, ranging from graffiti to the deliberate destruction of tracks and equipment, can cause substantial delays and repair costs. These activities are often politically motivated or carried out by disaffected individuals.</li>
  <li>Cyber Threats: The increasing reliance on digital systems for rail operations has introduced vulnerabilities to cyberattacks or internet blackout. Hackers can target control systems, potentially causing derailments, schedule disruptions, and significant safety hazards. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internet blackout</code> during the 2020 elections in Belarus significantly impacted the information transmission of the Eurasian rail freight.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="several-security-measures-could--be-implemented-across-the-eurasian-rail-network-to-mitigate-these-risks">Several security measures could  be implemented across the Eurasian rail network to mitigate these risks:</h4>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Surveillance Systems: Advanced CCTV and monitoring systems are in place at major rail hubs and along critical sections of the rail network. These systems help in the early detection of suspicious activities.</li>
  <li>Physical Security Enhancements: Barriers, fencing, and controlled access points have been established to protect rail infrastructure. Regular patrols and inspections are conducted to ensure the integrity of these physical security measures.</li>
  <li>Innovation in Technology: Investing in advanced technologies like AI-powered surveillance and blockchain for supply chain transparency can improve security.</li>
  <li>Intergovernmental Collaboration: Establishing international security frameworks and regular dialogues among the involved countries can foster better coordination and response strategies. However, the current <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Russia-Ukraine war</code> will make this more challenging.</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity Protocols: Robust cybersecurity frameworks have been developed to protect against digital threats. These include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular audits of IT infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Coordination and Response: Effective coordination between rail operators, law enforcement, and emergency services is crucial. Joint exercises and real-time information sharing help in maintaining a state of readiness.</li>
  <li>Legal framework across Borders: To protect the critical infrastructure, The European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) includes the Council Directive 2008/114/EC, which focuses on identifying and improving the protection of critical infrastructures across Europe. In the USA, the Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-7) establishes policies for critical infrastructure protection, identifying 17 sectors, each led by a federal Sector-Specific Agency to enhance protection and resilience.  Eurasian rail network that span multiple countries need <a href="#">harmonized security protocols</a>. This requires international cooperation and standardization of security measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="future-outlook">Future Outlook</h2>

<p><a href="#">The coordinated sabotage of France’s high-speed rail network during the Paris Olympic Games underscores the critical need for robust security measures for critical infrastructure </a>. While significant challenges remain, ongoing technological advancements and international cooperation are essential to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Eurasian rail transport. Policymakers and stakeholders must prioritize security to protect this critical infrastructure of the Eurasian rail transport. Implementing comprehensive security strategies that combine physical, digital, and procedural elements will be essential to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of Eurasian rail networks. Policymakers and stakeholders must prioritize security investments and foster international cooperation to address the dynamic nature of rail transport risks.</p>

The train ceremonially departed from Jinghe station at 11:30 local time.</p>

<p>The container train will pass through the Khorgos-Altynkol railway border crossing on the Kazakh-Chinese border and arrive at the port of Aktau, Kazakhstan on the Caspian Sea, where the containers will be loaded onto a feeder vessel owned by the Kazakh shipping company LLP “NMSC “Kazmortransflot” and delivered to the port of Baku (Alyat) in Azerbaijan. From there, the container block train will travel via the railways of Azerbaijan and Georgia to the port of Poti, Georgia. After arrival and processing at the port of Poti, the containers of tomato paste will be loaded onto the COSCO Shipping Container Lines vessel and then travel through the Black and Mediterranean Seas via the Greek port of Piraeus to the port of Naples in Italy.</p>

<p>The expected transit time for the train from Jinghe station to the port of Poti is 11 days, and a single transport document – the SMGS waybill – will be used along the entire length of the specified multimodal route.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the specialists of Kazakh Railways have developed a special schedule for the passage of container trains on the route Altynkol station – Aktau port, according to which the speed of container trains is about 1050 km/day, thanks to which trains cover this section of the route (3128 km) in 72 hours. Similar block train schedules are used on the railways of Azerbaijan and Georgia.</p>

<p>The service providers along the entire route of the block train from Altynkol station to the port of Poti are members of the International Trans-Caspian Transport Consortium (subsidiaries of full members of the TITR Association) – “KTZ Express”, “ADY Container”, “GR Logistics and Terminlas”.</p>

<p>Next week, another block train carrying tomato paste is scheduled to leave Urumqi for Italy on the TITR route. In addition, two container trains are planned for May and June this year, with the number and frequency of departures to be further increased.</p>

<p>Since 2018, the TITR Association has been closely and successfully cooperating with Xinjiang COSCO Shipping Container Lines Co., Ltd. on a multimodal rail-sea transport project from the XUAR of China to Italy along the TITR route.

<p>Examining Chinese border crossings, Alashankou Port maintained its position as the port with the highest rail freight traffic. With the rapid growth in China-Russia trade, both the China-Russia border crossing at Manzhouli Port and the China/Mongolia border port of Erenhot experienced substantial increases in traffic.</p>

<p>In contrast to other ports, Manzhouli and Suifenhe ports demonstrated a notable trend of more return trips than outbound trips, establishing them as the preferred customs clearance ports for Russian import cargo.</p>

<p>Tongjiang Railway Port made significant strides, initiating its first outbound train in July 2023 and the first return train at the end of October. This development bodes well for the future, aligning with the upward trajectory of China-Russia trade.</p>

<h2 id="decrease-on-china-europe-routes-excl-russian-routes">Decrease on China-Europe routes excl. Russian routes</h2>

<p>It is noteworthy that the aforementioned figures encompass the freight volume on the China-Russia routes. Excluding the Russian routes, the volume of freight transport between China and European countries witnessed a further decrease.</p>

<p>As reported by the ERAI EURASIAN RAIL ALLIANCE INDEX (index1520) for 2023, encompassing China and several European countries including Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Hungary, Spain, Italy, and France, a total of 211,110 TEUs were transported along the China-Europe routes. This indicates a significant decrease of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">48.57% </code>compared to 2022 and represents only one-third of the 2021 figure, which stood at 618,180 TEUs.</p>

<p>One notable consequence of the decline in freight volumes is the continual improvement in transport duration, with the average station-to-station transport time reducing to a mere 9.9 days.</p>

<h2 id="westbound-to-poland-eastbound-from-germany">Westbound to Poland, eastbound from Germany</h2>

<p>Poland continued to lead among European countries with the highest containerized cargo arriving on westbound trains, amounting to 117,628 TEUs, albeit experiencing a 34.11% year-on-year decline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, rail freight from China to Germany faced a substantial decline, with only 12,866 TEUs in 2023, marking an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">80.02%</code> drop. On the eastbound shipment front, Germany, known for its robust product exports, remained the country that shipped the most containers to China, reaching 58,282 TEUs but still experiencing a<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> 45.68% year-on-year decline</code>.</p>]]></content><author><name>rudy</name></author><category term="Eurasia" /><category term="sticky" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the year 2023, the China-Europe freight train has reached 17,000 trips, transporting 1.9 million TEUs, marking a notable increase of 6% and 18% year-on-year, as per the statistics released by the China State Railway Group.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/train2011_2023.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/train2011_2023.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Exclusive interview with Qi Dan</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/qidan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exclusive interview with Qi Dan" /><published>2023-11-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-11-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/qidan</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/qidan/"><![CDATA[<p>On August 22, 2023, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dan QI</code>, the General Manager of Yuxinou (Chongqing) Logistics Co., Ltd., bid a heartfelt farewell to his colleagues in his personal social circle. Yuxinou is the first platform company in China to operate the China-Europe freight train service. Dan QI has led this company for over a decade.</p>

<p>He wrote: “… What’s more important is whether the more than a decade of effort we’ve put in together is worth it. This depends on the future of the company in the next three, five, ten, twenty, and even thirty years. Without a future, all our current efforts will fade into insignificance, and they might even be forgotten, despite being a part of real history. With a future, our current efforts become precious and worthwhile, and they will be engraved in history. Therefore, I hope that my young comrades will do something for the future of the company. I envy the youthful years you possess. Although I’m leaving Yuxinou, you continue to stand firm and strive. If I must express regret, it’s simply that we won’t be sharing the same trench day in and day out, but my heart will always be with you and with Yuxinou…”</p>

</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dan QI</code>: It is undoubtedly the career of the China-Europe freight train service and the emotional connection with the entire Yuxinou team. I was seconded to the Logistics Office of Chongqing Municipal Government in 2011, initially responsible for the Chongqing International Air Cargo “Ice-Breaking” project, and later involved in the establishment of Yuxinou and related work. It has been more than a decade since then. Over these years, we have witnessed and been actively involved in the growth and development of Yuxinou and the entire China-Europe freight train industry. Along this journey, we have overcome many unknown challenges together and gained valuable experiences. The entire team has established deep bonds, and in a sense, we are like a family. This career is akin to our “child,” and we have invested a lot of effort into it. Seeing it thrive fills us with genuine happiness and pride. Now, saying goodbye to the “family” and “child” that have been with me for over a decade naturally brings a deep sense of reluctance and attachment in my heart.</p>

Could you share a few moments or highlights with us?</h4>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dan QI</code>: Yuxinou, as the first comprehensive logistics service provider representing Chongqing’s “Going Global” strategy, uniquely combining renowned brands, a national 5A-level logistics enterprise, and a five-star multimodal transport operator, has achieved several commendable accomplishments in its development. Personally, what I’m most proud of is its role in driving Chongqing’s outward openness and industrial development, especially its strategic significance during special times.</p>

<p>In 2014, we embarked on the exploration of running public trains for various industries, and subsequently, we developed various innovative transportation projects, including full-container loads, cold chain logistics, cross-border e-commerce, and more. As Yuxinou’s services steadily expanded, Chongqing also obtained approvals for multiple railway ports such as the automobile complete vehicle import port, the international mail handling center, and the bioproducts port. This led to a global “eight consecutive championships” in IT product output, the establishment of trillion-yuan level industrial clusters in the automobile and electronic information sectors, and the development of two national-level bonded zones, significantly raising the city’s level of outward openness. I believe this is a proactive response to the strategic positioning and goals for Chongqing, and Yuxinou has become a key driver in the creation of Chongqing’s inland openness and will continue to contribute to elevating the city’s openness and industrial economic development.</p>

<p>In early 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly erupted, maritime and air transport were severely impacted. It was during this time that the strategic role of China-Europe freight trains became even more apparent. I vividly recall that all of us acted promptly. First, we formed an emergency task force and were the first in the country to introduce the “Yuxinou (China-Europe freight train) COVID-19 Medical Supplies Transport Emergency Plan,” providing solutions for medical supply procurement entities and offering free warehouse space, free international railway transportation, and other support services for emergency goods. Our entire team, including on-site personnel ensuring the dispatch of train services and office staff on 24-hour standby, worked tirelessly to ensure uninterrupted and stable train operations. This included Yuxinou and other China-Europe freight train services, which became a “lifeline” for global cooperation in combating the pandemic.</p>

Where do you think Yuxinou’s innovation is reflected? What has Yuxinou been persistent in achieving?</h4>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dan QI</code>: Yuxinou’s innovation is reflected in its willingness to explore and break new ground. Over its development of more than a decade, Yuxinou has consistently adhered to the brand essence of “innovation, openness, connectivity, and mission,” continuously exploring new paths, and pioneering numerous innovative experiences, providing new directions for industry development.</p>

<p>For instance, in the establishment of new rules for land-based trade, Yuxinou broke the international railway postal ban and was the first to achieve two-way international railway postal connectivity. Subsequently, this international railway postal model was replicated and extended to other cities like Yiwu, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, and played a crucial role during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Yuxinou explored multimodal transport under a single document and issued the first “Railway Bill of Lading International Letter of Credit.” It actively promoted the use of bill of lading property rights and financial attributes, implementing the first blockchain electronic bill of lading financing business for China-Europe freight trains.</p>

<p>Yuxinou took the lead in improving China-Europe freight train transport efficiency by initiating projects like “Railway-Government Communication,” joint actions for transportation safety in countries along the route, and achieving two-way connectivity of “railway express” mode for imports and exports, effectively ensuring the safe and convenient transport of China-Europe freight trains and enhancing inland logistics organizational capacity.</p>

<p>In accelerating the innovation of logistics supply chain service models, Yuxinou was the first to conduct the industry’s first cross-border RMB payment transaction, reinforcing settlement security in foreign trade, and innovating with “blockchain + cross-border finance.” It strengthened cooperation between banks and enterprises, effectively addressing the financing challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises. These efforts represent Yuxinou’s innovative contributions to the betterment of the industry. I believe that in the future, Yuxinou will continue to adhere to its original mission and persist in its exploration, playing an even more active role in leading the industry’s innovative development.</p>

How should we interpret these changes, and how can industry participants adapt to, engage in, and drive these changes?</h4>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dan QI</code>: At the national level, structural changes are underway concerning route planning, overseas channel layout, and capacity deployment for China-Europe freight trains. China-Central Asia, China-Vietnam, and China-Laos (Thailand), among other rail services, have been incorporated into the overall development plan for China-Europe freight trains over the next 3 to 5 years. This extension of the China-Europe freight train service network aims to enhance connectivity between ASEAN, China, and Central Asia. Additionally, active participation in international cooperation for Trans-Caspian routes is taking place to further improve the southern routes of the China-Europe freight train.</p>

<p>As an industry practitioner, I believe it’s important to proactively change one’s perspective and make strategic adjustments in line with the overall development plan. Strengthening the development of the southern route for China-Europe freight trains is crucial. Continuously improving the train’s resilience to risks and further expanding routes and resource allocation in regions such as Central Asia and Southeast Asia is essential. By running freight train services, these regions’ economies can be more closely linked, promoting deeper exchanges in terms of trade, culture, and other aspects.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dan QI</code>: For the China-Europe freight train service to become a century-long endeavor, it is first and foremost essential to always remember its mission and responsibilities and consistently fulfill its positive role in supporting the “Belt and Road” initiative. Building on this foundation, efforts can be directed towards cost reduction, increased efficiency, and alignment with the volume and market environment, striving to achieve the vision of making the China-Europe freight train truly market-oriented. This also requires the collaborative efforts of all relevant departments, businesses, and all parties along the entire China-Europe freight train supply chain to jointly maintain the stability of the China-Europe freight train market. Emphasis on market-oriented operation is crucial to promote the industry’s healthy, sustainable development and to continually unlock the potential and vitality of the China-Europe freight train.</p>]]></content><author><name>rudy</name></author><category term="People" /><category term="featured" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On August 22, 2023, Dan QI, the General Manager of Yuxinou (Chongqing) Logistics Co., Ltd., bid a heartfelt farewell to his colleagues in his personal social circle.

</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mr. Hans Reinhard</code>: As the China-Europe trains are considered as a complementary to air and sea freight, and as the airfreight sector were hit the most during the last months, we indeed observed an increasing demand on the China-EU tradelane since China’s return to production.</p>

<p>Where as China was the first country hit by the pandemic, it originally was also the first country to (suddenly) reduce the numbers of trains thus the start in 2020 was extremely slow – then China re-started once the pandemic became controlled in China but at same time, COVID brought Westeurope into complete lockdown thus again March and April were very slow months as far as train departures between China and Europe were concerned.</p>

<p>As of May however, we could feel an increasing demand which even included regular blocktrains of postal shipments and since May, the numbers of trains has permanently increased reaching the peak in June/July. InterRail could face an increase of about 35% compared to figures of same period in 2019 were we operated approx 4 trains weekly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mr. Hans Reinhard</code>: With rail-focused services, InterRail addresses customers across the entire Eurasian region respectively along the New Silk Road. To support its freight brokerage services, InterRail draws on its own container fleet, and in the CIS, on its own and leased rolling stock. As a neutral service provider, the group moreover operates container block trains between Western Europe, Russia, the other CIS countries, Central Asia and China. We also operate our own block trains and individual wagons within the CIS/Russia. In addition to container transportation, our competence also includes the transport of goods in conventional rail wagons, like project and bulk cargo (cotton/fertilizers).</p>

<p>Among InterRail customers are forwarding and transport companies as well as ocean carriers and shipping lines.</p>

<p>InterRail has direct contracts with all the national railways in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and is specialized on CIS transit. The service portfolio also comprises end-to-end freight rates, documentation management, pre- and on-carriage, tracking and container provision.</p>

<p>For the smooth transport of rail freight between Europe and Asia, it takes a partner that is at home in every culture. That’s the strength of InterRail, due to its presence of long years in all the major states along this trade lane, with locations in Belarus, China, Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. We are on site at all critical interfaces with our own employees. As an affiliate of the TransInvest Group (St. Gallen, Switzerland), InterRail can additionally rely on the dense TransInvest network.</p>

<p>With the competent expertise of its staff and its long-time market presence, InterRail stands for top excellence in service.</p>

Has this year’s outbreak of the epidemic changed many things, and how do you see the future growth of the China-EU rail freight?</h4>
</blockquote>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mr. Hans Reinhard</code>: We believe that due to the pandemic, the reduction of the subsidies has not yet affected the number of train departures yet as there was a large backlog demand on different goods and commodities which the rail transport could benefit from. Secondly, the suboperators, ie. the state railways have positively supported this kind of transport by further reduction of their rates and tariffs to absorb part of the missing subsidizes, and secondly, by creating longer trains on CIS territory, ie linking 3 chinese trains into 2 CIS trains.</p>

<p>We however can also observe that some Chinese platforms have already started to focus more on shorter distances/destinations, ie mainly to Russia and Central Asia where less subsidies will be necessary.</p>

<p>On the long run, we still expect that present boom will not continue on long term base but volumes will stay solid on about 2019 average figures.</p>

<p>A further effect we can notice is the fact that due to less subsidies, the elbow fights between the different operators on rates and conditions have increased and the demand on intermediate financing by western operators has also increased.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mr. Hans Reinhard</code>: The situation at Alashankou / Dostyk has meanwhile get partly relaxed again where as Brest/Malascewicze has indeed become a extremely troublesome interface which is due to huge volumes of trains but also due to present construction works on both sides. InterRail still benefits from using private railway undertaking thus we can offer our “own” wagons and traction where as some state railways are also focusing lack of empty wagons.

</blockquote>

<p>Beijing Institute of Logistics &amp; Transport of ZJX have started the comprehensive investigation of the integration of transportation, trade, industry and city on China-Europe freight train since the 4th quarter of 2019, in order to carry the Belt and Road Initiative(BRI) , implement the strategy of transportation power and promote the high-quality development of China-Europe freight train. The research contents mainly included the operating quality, the hub layout , intelligent transportation, the stable supply chain and melt situation and so on. We have made the new achievements in the development of China-Europe freight train, mainly as follows:</p>

<p>In Prof. Wang Derong view, First, the China-Europe freight train is conducive to promoting the economic and trade development of countries and regions along the route. The quantity and quality of the trains operation are constantly improving, which has been paid more and more attention by all walks of the economy and society. Second, the new progress has been made in the interconnection of the infrastructure of trains, not only to enhance the freight capacity of the international transport corridor, but also to play the role of the strategic channel of international trade. Third, the layout of the China-Europe train hub is gradually optimized. Give full play to the role of “hub to hub” in the efficient collection and distribution system. Fourth, in the context of free trade zone, the development of cross-border E-commerce of the China-Europe train has played a prominent role in the internationalization of inland cities. Fifth, the construction of the China-Europe train intelligent information platform has been steadily promoted. Intellectualization has become an important platform for trains to connect coastal ports and inland hinterland development. Sixth, China-EU has played an active role in international cargo transportation and the resumption of work, production. The stability and competitiveness of the supply chain of the China-Europe train has been put on the important agenda, which is the real “road of life” between Eurasia.</p>

In your opinion, what role does the construction of China’s smart logistics backbone network play in promoting the high-quality development of China Europe freight trains?</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>In my view, China Smart Logistic Network (CSN) is the top-level design for the high-quality development of China’s logistics industry in the new era, and it is a Chinese solution contributing to the global supply chain. CSN plays an important role in promoting the high-quality development of China- Europe train. First, CSN promotes the intensive operation of China-EU trains. CSN considers the comprehensive transportation corridors and hubs from an international perspective, and innovates the “hub to hub” transportation organization mode of trains. Second, CSN promote the international development of the train, which gives full play to the advantages of global network, provides the “one-stop” efficient service of the China- Europe train global supply chain, gives full play to the advantages of multimodal transport, and promotes the facilitation of international trade of trains. Third, CSN promotes the market-oriented construction of trains. Through the construction of train platform, CSN uses the digital port to carry out value-added services such as LCL and return pick-up, give full play to the advantages of the China-Europe train and realize the green vision. Fourth, cultivate new driving force of the train. CSN carries out cross-border e-commerce train business, integrates bonded warehousing, sorting and distribution, picking and packing, and LCL services in the qualified comprehensive bonded zone, and cultivates a new economic growth pole.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After recent years’ development, the platform and freight forwarding company of the China-Europe train have been “going global” and expanding international business. For the “going global” of Chinese logistics enterprises, I believe that we should adhere to the principle of opening to the outside world, judge the opportunities and challenges faced in the future, actively carry out international supply chain business, and make strategic layout planning at important hub nodes.</p>

<p>For the future investment and merger of Chinese enterprises in overseas real estate and other infrastructure, my suggestions are as follows: first, optimize the strategic layout of the overseas hub. Carefully analyze the development trend of local economy and trade, understand and be familiar with the local political environment, folk customs, etc., analyze and prevent risks; second, encourage the diversification of investment and financing channels. Third, to provide local economic development and employment opportunities.</p>

What can be done to the New Silkroad Discovery in this process?</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>In my view, the China-EU train has promoted the construction of the “the Five-Connectivity Program”, the connectivity of policy, infrastructure, trade, finance and people. It needs the support of the government and the people, and the support of international public opinion is particularly important. The media of the China-Europe train industry adhere to the principle of innovation, use new media, grasp the pulse of the times, actively promote the “going out” of China’s logistics enterprises, improve the construction and reform of the global traffic governance system, promote the “Introduction” and “going out” of the China-Europe train in policies, rules, systems, technologies and standards, and enhance the international voice and influence of the industry.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 and further play the role of the China-Europe train, many ministries and commissions in China have issued guidance on relevant work, mainly as follows: First, use the China-Europe train to help enterprises resume to work and serve Wuhan; Second, we strengthen the construction of the China-EU train assembly center, promote the diversification of China-EU train export channels; Third, enhance the internationalization of China Europe train enterprises To build an international multimodal transport logistics service network focusing on China Europe train. The fourth is to guide enterprises to make full use of the customs clearance and facilitation policies of the China-EU trains, and is to encourage the replication and promotion of the innovation results of the China-EU trains in the pilot free trade zone; the fifth is to ensure that foreign-funded enterprises can equally apply the support policies of the China EU trains; the sixth is to do a good job in the early warning and consultation of the restrictive measures of countries along with the China-EU trains, and strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic situation of the China-EU trains. Seventh we will strengthen the stability and competitiveness of the international supply chain of China Europe trains and give priority to international cooperation in the transportation of anti-epidemic materials. Eighth, to support the development of cold chain logistics and other new industries of the China-EU trains and improve the level of information technology.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With the outbreak of the COVID-19, China has encountered many difficulties and challenges in its development. The WTO （issued on 8 April 2020）estimates that world merchandise trade could decline by between 12.9% and 31.9% in 2020. Compared with sea transportation and air transportation, the China-EU trains still maintain normal and stable transportation, and the overall trend of development will continue to grow rapidly in the next two years.</p>

<p>I think that New Silkroad Discovery is the whole media for the high-quality development of the China-Europe Railway promoted by the Internet, which grasps the pulse of the times. The media is widely integrated with the government, entrepreneurs, experts, etc. it has a wide range of communication power and external publicity windows. The new technology, mechanism and model of news communication attracts many fans. Thanks for fans’ attention to the development of China-Europe Freight Railway. Thank you for your attention to the China-Europe Freight Railway, which is the landmark achievement of the “Belt and Road” construction is the contribution of the growth of train.</p>
